# VideoAlarmClock

A program that accepts command line arguments for what time to go off, and when it does it launches a Youtube video 
in a new browser tab that will start playing. The program reads in a text file that contains URLs to different 
Youtube videos and will randomly choose one and launch it. It also switches audio output to my monitor's speakers 
and sets the volume to max (to ensure I hear it).

Makes use of [tkinter_components](https://github.com/moshekaplan/tkinter_components) (with some slight modifications).
